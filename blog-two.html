            <h2> Understanding JavaScript </h2>

    <p> <strong> By Dane Morte </strong> </p>

    <p> <strong> What is JavaScript </strong> </p>

    <p> <strong> JavaScript </strong> often abbreviated as <strong> JS </strong>, is a programming language and core technology of the World Wide Web, alongside <a href="index.html" target="_blank">HTML</a> and <a href="blog-one.html" target="_blank">CSS</a>. 99% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.
    </p>

    <p> <strong> JavaScript </strong> is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard. It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multiparadigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).     
    </p>

    <p>
    The <b>ECMAScript </b> standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.   
    </p>

    <p> JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but are now core components of some servers and a variety of applications. The most popular runtime system for this usage is Node.js. </p>

    <p> Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design. </p>

                <h3> Website Client-side Usage </h3>

    <p><strong> JavaScript </strong> is the dominant client-side scripting language of the Web, with 99% of all websites using it for this purpose.[10] Scripts are embedded in or included from HTML documents and interact with the DOM.
    </p>

    <p> All major web browsers have a built-in JavaScript engine that executes the code on the user's device. </p>

    <h4> Examples of Scripted Behavior </h4>

    <ul>
        <li>Loading new web page content without reloading the page, via Ajax or a WebSocket. For example, users of social media can send and receive messages without leaving the current page.</li>
        <li> Web page animations, such as fading objects in and out, resizing, and moving them. </li>
        <li> Playing browser games. </li>
        <li> Controlling the playback of streaming media. </li>
        <li> Generating pop-up ads or alert boxes </li>
        <li> Validating input values of a web form before the data is sent to a web server </li>
        <li>Logging data about the user's behavior then sending it to a server. The website owner can use this data for analytics, ad tracking, and personalization.</li>
        <li> Redirecting a user to another page. </li>
        <li> Storing and retrieving data on the user's device, via the storage or IndexedDB standards.</li>
    </ul>
